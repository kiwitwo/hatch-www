                        Hatch is a third-party project hosting service for the
                        Scratch programming language. Scratch is a great option
                        to learn the fundamentals of programming, but it is
                        designed for young children. Many Scratchers
                        understandably find themselves outgrowing Scratch as
                        they get older, and/or have distaste for new Scratch
                        features, but they want to keep using the Scratch
                        language. Hatch was designed with this group of users in
                        mind. While we're very similar to Scratch, having a
                        close online community, we have more relaxed rules.

                        are under 13, you are welcome to use Hatch while logged
                        out and access any non-13+ projects.

                    <div class="faqa">
                        There are other good third-party options for hosting
                        Scratch projects. However, Hatch is far less limited. We
                        are very transparent between the Hatch Team and
                        Hatchlings (users), and our rules are much more relaxed.
                        We also contain features that some other similar sites
                        may not, such as commenting.

                    <div class="faqa">
                        We haven't implemented an editor yet because we didn't
                        see a huge need to add one immediately. Instead, you can
                        make a project in the official
                        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/editor"

                            >TurboWarp Editor</a

                        No. Scratch has rules that prohibit sharing links to
                        websites with looser moderation guidelines, because
                        Scratch is a platform for users of all ages. <strong>Please do
                        not share links to Hatch or mention Hatch anywhere on
                        the Scratch website.</strong>

                        There's a ratings system? How does that work?

                    <div class="faqa">
                        Yeah. When you upload a project to Hatch, <a href="https://dev.hatch.lol/hatch-team/">moderators</a>
                        will review your project and determine what age group
                        the project is appropriate for. There are four ratings:
                        <br>
                        <strong>E</strong>: Suitable for all ages. Comparable to
                        what you would find on Scratch.
                        <br>
                        <strong>7+</strong>: Not 9+-level inappropriate, but
                        would be marked as <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/NFE">NFE</a> on Scratch.
                        <br>
                        <strong>9+</strong>: Projects at this rating would
                        be taken down if they were uploaded to Scratch.
                        May contain anything from the previous ratings, as
                        well as some violence, mild cartoonish blood, light
                        profanity, personal information, and intense scares.
                        <br>
                        <strong>13+</strong>: May contain anything from the
                        previous ratings, as well as profanity usage,
                        intense cartoonish blood, intense violence, and mild
                        suggestive themes. You must be logged in to view 13+
                        projects.
                        <br>
                        Anything more inappropriate than what a 13+ project would
                        contain is not welcome on Hatch, and you will receive punishment
                        for attempting to upload projects of such nature.
