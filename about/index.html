  <div id="paragraph1">Hatch is a third-party project hosting service for the Scratch programming language. Scratch is a great option to learn the fundamentals of programming, but it is designed for young children. Many Scratchers understandably find themselves outgrowing Scratch as they get older, and/or have distaste for new Scratch features, but they want to keep using the Scratch language. Hatch was designed with this group of users in mind. While we're very similar to Scratch, having a close online community, we have more relaxed rules.</div>

      <div class="faqq">Why should I use Hatch?</div>
      <div class="faqa">
        There are other good third-party options for hosting Scratch projects. However, Hatch is far less limited. We are very transparent between the Hatch Team and Hatchlings (users), and our rules are much more relaxed. We also contain features that some other similar sites may not, such as commenting.

      <div class="faqq">Why don't you have an editor?</div>
      <div class="faqa">
        We haven't implemented an editor yet because we didn't see a huge need to add one immediately. Instead, you can make a project in the official <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/editor">Scratch Editor</a> or the third-party <a href="https://turbowarp.org/editor">TurboWarp Editor</a>, then upload the *.sb3 file to Hatch.
